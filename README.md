In meteorology, [**CMax(Z)** (short for "Composite Maximum Reflectivity")](https://www.bmkg.go.id/cuaca/citra-radar.bmkg) refers to the maximum radar reflectivity observed within a vertical column of the atmosphere, typically represented in decibels of reflectivity (**dBZ**). This measure is particularly useful in identifying the most intense parts of a storm and areas of heavy precipitation.

**Vertical Integration**: CMax(Z) does not reflect a specific altitude but rather shows the highest reflectivity value within the entire vertical profile above a particular location.

**Intensity Indication**: Since CMax represents the highest value, it helps highlight areas with intense weather activity, such as thunderstorms or hail.

**Precipitation Estimation**: Higher dBZ values often indicate higher precipitation rates, with values above 40-50 dBZ commonly associated with heavy rain or hail.

**Use in Severe Weather Forecasting**: CMax is especially useful in identifying severe storm cores, where intense updrafts and precipitation often lead to dangerous weather phenomena like hail, strong winds, or tornadoes.

CMax(Z) is a crucial tool for forecasters and meteorologists to assess storm severity and provide warnings for areas potentially impacted by severe weather.

Weather radar imagery describes the potential intensity of rainfall detected by the weather radar. The measurement of rainfall intensity (precipitation) by the weather radar is based on the amount of radar energy reflected back by water droplets in clouds, represented by the product Reflectivity with units of dBZ (decibels). The greater the reflected energy received by the radar, the higher the dBZ value, and a higher dBZ reflectivity value indicates a higher intensity of rainfall.

**Rainfall Intensity Categories:**

| Rainfall Intensity Category | dBZ Value Range | mm/hour |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Light rain                  | 25 to 35        | 1 to 5  |
| Moderate rain               | 35 to 45        | 5 to 10 |
| Heavy rain                  | 45 to 55        | 10 to 20|
| Very heavy rain             | > 55            | > 20    |
